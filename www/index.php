							<h2>My short story</h2> 
							<br>
							<p>My name is Andrii Lebid, and I graduated from New Brunswick Community College with a Web and Mobile application development course in June 2024. Now that my studies have ended and I have finished a work-integrated internship in Advatek Systems, I am looking for job opportunities. I was happy to know that you have open positions because I believe I meet all the requirements. So, I would like to apply for this position. </p><br>
							
							<p>NBCC is not my first education; 20 years ago, I received an education at a university in Ukraine specializing in electronics production, after which I worked for 17 years as a technician. After arriving in Canada, I worked at Walmart for two years and am very familiar with customer service. The first time I came across web development was when I volunteered for the Harvest House charity organization, where I supported their corporate website, and I decided to go to college because I was very interested but needed more knowledge. During two years of college, I learned HTML5 and CSS3, Angular, JavaScript, C#, Java, PHP, databases MSSQL, server site development NODE, and ASP.NET. My knowledge in Web & Mobile Development, previous technical experience, and customer service experience is a unique combination that can help with many of your projects.</p><br>

							<p>I am sure that my qualifications and previous experience will be beneficial to your company, and I would very much appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in person.</p>
